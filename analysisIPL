Analysis and Prediction for the Indian Premier League IPL Match Outcome Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of IPL (Indian Premier League) T20 matches using a variety of traditional and novel features. It explores historical data from 2015–2019 and includes advanced feature engineering, classification models, and model explainability via SHAP values.

Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze and predict match outcomes in the Indian Premier League using machine learning. It combines data-driven insights with domain-specific features like toss decisions, player impact, team form, and venue-specific factors.

Dataset

Primary Data Sources:

ESPNcricinfo: Match summaries and player stats.
Kaggle IPL Dataset: Ball-by-ball match data.
Augmented Data:

Weather reports (OpenWeatherMap API)
Pitch reports from IPL broadcasters
The dataset includes:

Match metadata (teams, toss result, venue, etc.)
Team performance metrics (batting/bowling averages, total runs)
Player-level statistics (Player of the Match awards, strike rates)
Feature Engineering

Features were categorized into:

Traditional Features

Feature	Description
Toss Winner	Binary indicator if team won the toss
Home Venue	Boolean flag for home advantage
Novel Features

Feature	Formula	Description
Team Form (EWMA)	EWMA = α * outcome + (1 - α) * prev_EWMA (α = 0.3)	Gives more weight to recent results
Player Impact Index	(POTM Awards / Total Matches) * 10	Measures clutch performance
Venue Toss Bias	Wins after winning toss at venue / Total matches at venue	Captures venue-specific toss advantage
Machine Learning Pipeline

Preprocessing

One-hot encoding for categorical features
Min-max scaling for numerical features
Feature Selection

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select top 15 features
Classification Models Used

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Results

Model	Accuracy	Precision	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	95.6%	0.94	0.97
XGBoost	96.1%	0.95	0.98
Random Forest	93.2%	0.92	0.96
Decision Tree	87.8%	0.88	0.91
SVM	83.6%	0.84	0.89
Naive Bayes	81.6%	0.80	0.85
Model Interpretability (SHAP)

Top 3 Predictive Features:

Toss Decision at Venue — SHAP = 0.42
Team Form (EWMA) — SHAP = 0.38
Player Impact Index — SHAP = 0.35
These insights reflect how tactical and performance-related features drive prediction accuracy.
